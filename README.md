# Heating-X2-code-generator
Installation aid for the Home Assistant Blueprint **Heating X2**

Uses Microsoft Mail Merge to create YAML files for all the template sensors and helpers required for a complete home heating system using the Home Assistant Blueprint **Heating X2** for each room. Microsoft Office (WORD and EXCEL) is a prerequisite (sorry I could not find a free package to do this) 

To get started download the ZIP file to a temporary location on a local disk drive (e.g. the downloads folder) and unzip it. Problems can occur if it is used on a drive that is synchronised to a cloud service, such as iCloud or OneDrive.

In the resulting folder there are detailed instructions, an EXCEL data file and a WORD mail merge file for each YAML file. 

Please see the *Instructions* inside the package for full details of how to use the code generator.
