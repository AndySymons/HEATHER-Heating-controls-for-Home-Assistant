# Project HEATHER 

This project consolidates all the components of my Home Assistant heating control system: 
- The three HA blueprints
  - **Heating X2**
  - **Calendar Switch Y2**
  - **Zone Switch Z2**
- The **Heating XYZ Code Generator**
  - A series of WORD (.docx) mailmerge files that are used to create YAML files for HA
  - An example EXCEL (.xls) mail merge data file  
- The packaged script for **Logfile Entry**

The files in this repository supercede all previous versions of the files in other locations. 
(Previously the blueprints and script were published as separate Gists and the Code Generator was at this location as 'Heating XYZ Code Generator' with no directory structure).  

The reorganisation is made solely for ease of maintenance. The current version (2.4) is compatible with all previous version 2.x intallations (not with 1.x, which is deprecated and no longer supported). 

### To get started
Download and read the **Guide** PDF from the root folder.
It contains full instruction on how to install and configure a full home smart heating system using the tools and components in this repository.
