# Project HEATHER -- Heating XYZ Code Generator

Installation aid for the Home Assistant Blueprints **Heating X2**, **Calendar Switch Y2**, and **Zone Switch Z2**, 

Uses Microsoft Mail Merge to create YAML files for all the template sensors and helpers required for a complete home heating system. Microsoft Office (WORD and EXCEL) is a prerequisite (sorry I could not find a free package to do this).
  
To get started download the ZIP file to a temporary location on a local disk drive (e.g. the downloads folder) and unzip it. Problems can occur if it is used on a drive that is synchronised to a cloud service, such as iCloud or OneDrive.

In the resulting folder there is a **Guide**, an EXCEL data file and a WORD mail merge file for each YAML file. 

Please see the *Guide* inside the package for tips on setting up a full home smart heating system and details of how to use the code generator.
