# Project HEATHER 

This project consolidates all the components of my Home Assistant heating control system: 
- The three HA blueprints
  - **Heating X2**
  - **Calendar Switch Y2**
  - **Zone Switch Z2**
- The **Heating XYZ Code Generator** 
- The packaged script for **Logfile Entry**

The files in this repository supercede all previous versions of these files in other locations (previously the blueprints and script were published as Gists and the Code Generator was at this location as 'Heating XYZ Code Generator' with no directory structure).  

To get started, download and read the **Guide** PDF from the root folder, for instruction on how to set up a full home smart heating system and details of how to use the blueprints, script and code generator.
